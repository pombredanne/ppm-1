Project Package Manager

This is not a replacement of language/platform dependent package managers (like Python pip or node.js npm), it's destined for managing general project dependencies, especially binaries. 

Because it's not targeted for a specific platform or a language, there is no pre-existant repository which holds dependencies, it's the role of a project member to create a packages registry and add meta information of dependencies ( creating Packages).

## How it works



## Registry server Configuration
the registry server is couchdb 

## Mirror server configuration
