Project Package Manager

This is not a replacement of language/platform dependent package managers (like Python pip or node.js npm), it's destined for managing general project dependencies, especially binaries, and creating a "virtual" environment

Because it's not targeted for a specific platform or a language, there is no pre-existant repository which holds dependencies, it's the role of a project member to create a packages registry and add meta information of dependencies (creating Packages).

PPM offers also the possiblity of creating a mirror server (packages repository), which is useful in case you want to download packages and serve them locally.

## Quick start
download and install pip using:
`pip install ppm`



## Registry server Configuration
the registry server is couchdb 

## Mirror server configuration
